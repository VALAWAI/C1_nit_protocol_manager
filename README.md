# C1_nit_protocol_manager

The C1 NIT protocol manager receives treatments and checks if they follow the NIT protocol.
You can read more about this service and the payload of the message on
the [aysncapi](asyncapi.yaml) or on the [component documentation](https://valawai.github.io/docs/components/C1/nit_protocol_manager).

## Generate Docker image

The easy way to create the docker image of this component is to execute
the next script.
 
 ```
./buildDockerImages.sh
```

At the end you must have the docker image **valawai/c1_nit_protocol_manager:Z.Y.Z**
where **X.Y.Z** will be the version of the component. If you want to have
the image with another tag, for example **latest**, you must call the script
with this tag as a parameter, for example:

```
./buildDockerImages.sh latest
```

And you will obtain the container **valawai/c1_nit_protocol_manager:latest**.


### Docker environment variables

The most useful environment variables on the docker image are:

 - **RABBITMQ_HOST** is the host where the RabbitMQ is available.
 The default value is **mov-mq**.
 - **RABBITMQ_PORT** defines the port of the RabbitMQ.
 The default value is **5672**.
 - **RABBITMQ_USERNAME** contains the username of the user who can access RabbitMQ.
 The default value is **mov**.
 - **RABBITMQ_PASSWORD** is the password used to authenticate the user who can access the RabbitMQ.
 The default value is **password**.
 - **LOG_LEVEL** defines the level of the log messages to be stored.
 The default value is **INFO**.
 - **QUARKUS_HTTP_HOST** contains the server host that will expose the REST health endpoints.
 The default value is __0.0.0.0__.
 - **QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT** defines the server port that will expose the REST health endpoints.
 The default value is __8080__.
 - **C1_NIT_PROTOCOL_MANAGER_NORMS_FILE** contains the path to the file with the norms to validate
 the NIT protocol. The default value is ___eu/valawai/c1_nit_protocol_manager/nit-protocol.drl___.
 - **C1_NIT_PROTOCOL_MANAGER_NORMS_TYPE** contains the name of the type of the norms expressed in the file.
 The default value is ___DRL___.
 
### Docker health check

This component exposes the following REST endpoints to check their health status.

 - **/q/health/live** can be used to check if the component is running.
 - **/q/health/ready** can be used to check if the component can process the messages
  from the VALAWAI infrastructure.
 - **/q/health/started** can be used to check if the component has started.
 - **/q/health** can be used to obtain all the previous check procedures in the component.
 
All of them will return a JSON which will have the **status** of the state (**UP** or **DOWN**)
and the list of **checks** that have been evaluated. It looks like the following example was obtained
from doing a **GET** over the **/q/health** endpoint.

 
 ```json
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Registered C1 NIT protocol manager",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "SmallRye Reactive Messaging - liveness check",
            "status": "UP",
            "data": {
                "received_treatment": "[OK]",
                "registered": "[OK]",
                "send_log": "[OK]",
                "send_unregister_component": "[OK]",
                "send_register_component": "[OK]",
                "send_treatment_action_feedback": "[OK]"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "Norm engine",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "SmallRye Reactive Messaging - readiness check",
            "status": "UP",
            "data": {
                "received_treatment": "[OK]",
                "registered": "[OK]",
                "send_log": "[OK]",
                "send_unregister_component": "[OK]",
                "send_register_component": "[OK]",
                "send_treatment_action_feedback": "[OK]"
            }
        },
        {
            "name": "SmallRye Reactive Messaging - startup check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
```
 
An alternative is to see the state of the component using the health user interface that
is exposed at [/q/health-ui/](http://localhost:8080/q/health-ui/).
 
These endpoints are useful to do the **healthcheck** in a **docker compose**. Thus, you can add
the following section into the service of the component.

```
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "curl -s http://localhost:8080/q/health | grep -m 1 -P \"^[\\s|\\{|\\\"]+status[\\s|\\:|\\\"]+.+\\\"\" |grep -q \"\\\"UP\\\"\""]
      interval: 1m
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 1m
      start_interval: 5s
```

Finally, remember that the  docker environment variables **QUARKUS_HTTP_HOST** and **QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT**
can be used to configure where the REST health endpoints will be exposed by the component.


## Deploy

On the file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml), you can see how the docker image
of this component can be deployed on a valawai environment. On this file is defined
the profile **mov**, that can be used to launch
the [Master Of Valawai (MOV)](https://github.com/VALAWAI/MOV). You can use the next
command to start this component with the MOV.

```
COMPOSE_PROFILES=mov docker compose up -d
```

After that, if you open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)
you can view the MOV user interface. Also, you can access the RabbitMQ user interface
at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) with the credentials **mov:password**.

The docker compose defines some variables that can be modified by creating a file named
[**.env**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/env-file/) where 
you write the name of the variable plus equals plus the value.  As you can see in
the next example.

```
MQ_HOST=rabbitmq.valawai.eu
MQ_USERNAME=c1_nit_protocol_manager
MQ_PASSWORD=lkjagb_ro82tÂ¿134
```

The defined variables are:


 - **C1_NIT_PROTOCOL_MANAGER_TAG** is the tag of the C1 NIT protocol manager docker image to use.
  The default value is ___latest___.
 - **MQ_HOST** is the hostname of the message queue broker that is available.
  The default value is ___mq___.
 - **MQ_PORT** is the port of the message queue broker is available.
  The default value is ___5672___.
 - **MQ_UI_PORT** is the port of the message queue broker user interface is available.
  The default value is ___8081___.
 - **MQ_USER** is the name of the user that can access the message queue broker.
  The default value is ___mov___.
 - **MQ_PASSWORD** is the password to authenticate the user that can access the message queue broker.
  The default value is ___password___.
 - **RABBITMQ_TAG** is the tag of the RabbitMQ docker image to use.
  The default value is ___management___.
 - **MONGODB_TAG** is the tag of the MongoDB docker image to use.
  The default value is ___latest___.
 - **MONGO_PORT** is the port where MongoDB is available.
  The default value is ___27017___.
 - **MONGO_ROOT_USER** is the name of the root user for the MongoDB.
  The default value is ___root___.
 - **MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD** is the password of the root user for the MongoDB.
  The default value is ___password___.
 - **MONGO_LOCAL_DATA** is the local directory where the MongoDB will be stored.
  The default value is ___~/mongo_data/movDB___.
 - **MOV_DB_NAME** is the name of the database used by the MOV.
  The default value is ___movDB___.
 - **MOV_DB_USER_NAME** is the name of the user used by the MOV to access the database.
  The default value is ___mov___.
 - **MOV_DB_USER_PASSWORD** is the password of the user used by the MOV to access the database.
  The default value is ___password___.
 - **MOV_TAG** is the tag of the MOV docker image to use.
  The default value is ___latest___.
 - **MOV_UI_PORT** is the port where the MOV user interface is available.
  The default value is ___8080___.

The database is only created the first time where script is called. So, if you modify
any of the database parameters you must create again the database. For this, you must
remove the directory defined by the parameter **MONGO_LOCAL_DATA** and start again
the **docker compose**.

You can stop all the started containers with the command:

```
COMPOSE_PROFILES=mov docker compose down
```
  
## Development

You can start the development environment with the script:

```shell script
./startDevelopmentEnvironment.sh
```

After that, you have a bash shell where you can interact with
the Quarkus development environment. You can start the development
server with the command:

```shell script
startServer
```

Alternatively, to run the test using the started Quarkus client, you can use Maven.

 * __quarkus dev__  start the component in development mode.
 * __mvn test__  to run all the tests
 * __mvnd test__  to run all the tests on debugging mode.
 * __mvn -DuseDevMOV=true test__  to run all the tests using the started Master of VALAWAI,
 	instead of an independent container.

Also, this starts the tools:

 * **RabbitMQ**  The server to manage the messages to interchange with the components.
 The management web interface can be opened at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) with the credential
 **mov**:**password**.
 * **MongoDB**  The database to store the data used by the MOV. The database is named as **movDB** and the user credentials **mov:password**.
 * **Mongo express**  the web interface to interact with the MongoDB. The web interface
  can be opened at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) with the credential
 **mov**:**password**.
 * **Master of VALAWAI**  The component that manages the topology connections between components.
  The web interface can be opened at [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084).
